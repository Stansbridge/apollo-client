---

The Apollo Client can easily be dropped into any JavaScript frontend where you want to use data from a GraphQL server.

## Installing

```txt
npm install apollo-client
```

To use this client in a web browser or mobile app, you'll need a build system capable of loading NPM packages on the client. Some common choices include Browserify, Webpack, and Meteor 1.3. Move on to the next article to see how to import and initialize the client.

## Initializing

The Apollo Client class is the thing you import from this package, and should be instantiated to communicate with your server. You can instantiate as many clients as you want, but most apps will have exactly one of these. If you want to talk to multiple backends, the right place to do that is in your GraphQL server.

<h3 id="ApolloClient" title="ApolloClient">new ApolloClient(options)</h3>

Instantiate a new Apollo Client.

- `networkInterface: NetworkInterface` (Optional, defaults to an interface that points to `/graphql`) The network interface to use when sending GraphQL queries to the server.
- `reduxRootKey: string` (Optional, `apollo` by default) The key under which Apollo data will be stored in the Redux store. [Read more about integrating with Redux](customization.html#redux). If you aren't integrating with an existing Redux store, don't worry about this.

Here's how you would instantiate a default client that points to `/graphql`:

```js
// In ES2015 or TypeScript
import ApolloClient from 'apollo-client';

const client = new ApolloClient();
```

If you're not using ES2015, you can also load it with `require`:

```js
// In plain JavaScript
var ApolloClient = require('apollo-client').default;
```

The rest of the code snippets will use ES2015 import syntax.

<h3 id="createNetworkInterface" title="createNetworkInterface">createNetworkInterface(url, options)</h3>

Create a new HTTP network interface that points to a GraphQL server at a specific URI.

- `url: string` The URL of the remote server, for example `https://example.com/graphql`.
- `options: FetchOptions` (Optional) Options that are passed through to `fetch` XXX link to docs

Here's how you would instantiate a new client with a custom endpoint URL:

```js
import ApolloClient, { createNetworkInterface } from 'apollo-client';

const networkInterface = createNetworkInterface('https://example.com/graphql');

const client = new ApolloClient({
  networkInterface,
});
```
