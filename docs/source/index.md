description: Introduction to the Apollo Data Stack.

Apollo is a data stack for modern apps, built with [GraphQL](https://medium.com/apollo-stack/the-basics-of-graphql-in-5-links-9e1dc4cac055#.576me0i04). It's a decoupled set of packages, including a GraphQL client, a set of tools for a GraphQL-JS server, and various client-side integrations.

Apollo is currently in the technical preview stage. This means there are still many features to build and bugs to iron out (check the GitHub issues for the [various repositories](https://github.com/apollostack)), but we think what we have now shows the general direction of the project, and is usable by adventurous developers who want to participate actively in the project. Give it a shot, and let us know how it goes!
