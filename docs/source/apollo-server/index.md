Apollo GraphQL Tools are a collection of functions and an opinionated guide for building GraphQL servers in JavaScript.

## Installing

```txt
npm install graphql-tools
```
The Apollo GraphQL tools are made for building servers, but they can also be used in the browser, for example to mock a backend during development or testing. Even though our guide recommends a specific way of building GraphQL servers, you can use these tools even if you don't follow our guide; they work with any GraphQL-JS schema, and each tool can be useful on its own. Information on how to use individual tools with GraphQL-JS can be found in the Tools section of this guide.
