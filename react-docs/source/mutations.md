title: Mutations
---

In addition to fetching data using queries, Apollo also handles GraphQL mutations. Mutations are identical to queries in syntax, the only difference being that you use the keyword `mutation` instead of `query` to indicate that the root fields on this query are going to be performing writes to the backend.

```js
mutation {
  submitRepository(repoFullName: "apollostack/apollo-client") {
    id
    repoName
  }
}
```

GraphQL mutations represent two things in one query string:

1. The mutation field name with arguments, `submitRepository`, which represents the actual operation to be done on the server
2. The fields you want back from the result of the mutation to update the client: `{ id, repoName }`

The above mutation will submit a new GitHub repository to GitHunt, saving an entry to the database. The result might be:

```
{
  "data": {
    "submitRepository": {
      "id": "123",
      "repoName": "apollostack/apollo-client"
    }
  }
}
```

When we use mutations in Apollo, the result is typically integrated into the cache automatically [based on the id of the result](cache-updates.html#dataIdFromObject), which in turn updates the UI automatically, so we often don't need to explicitly handle the results. In order for the client to correctly do this, we need to ensure we select the necessary fields in the result. One good strategy can be to simply ask for any fields that might have been affected by the mutation.

<h2 id="basics">Basic Mutations</h2>

Using `graphql` with mutations makes it easy to bind actions to components. Unlike queries, which provide a complicated object with lots of metadata and methods, mutations provide only a simple function to the wrapped component, in the `mutate` prop.

```js
import React, { Component, PropTypes } from 'react';
import { gql, graphql } from 'react-apollo';

class NewEntry extends Component { ... }
NewEntry.propTypes = {
  mutate: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
};

const submitRepository = gql`
  mutation submitRepository {
    submitRepository(repoFullName: "apollostack/apollo-client") {
      createdAt
    }
  }
`;

const NewEntryWithData = graphql(submitRepository)(NewEntry);
```

If you need more than one mutation on a component, you make a graphql container for each:

```js
const NewEntryWithData =  graphql(submitNewUser, {name : 'newUserMutation'})(
  graphql(submitRepository, {name: 'newRepositoryMutation'})(Component)
)
```

Note the use of the [`name` option on the `graphql()` call](higher-order-components.html#graphql-api) to name the prop that will receive the mutation function for each mutation (by default that name is 'mutate').

<h3 id="calling-mutations">Calling mutations</h3>

Most mutations will require arguments in the form of query variables, and you may wish to also provide other options to [ApolloClient#mutate](/core/apollo-client-api.html#ApolloClient.mutate).

You can directly pass options to the default `mutate` prop when you call it in the wrapped component:

```js
import React, { Component, PropTypes } from 'react';
import { gql, graphql } from 'react-apollo';

class NewEntry extends Component {
  onClick() {
    this.props.mutate({ variables: { repoFullName: 'apollostack/apollo-client' } })
      .then(({ data }) => {
        console.log('got data', data);
      }).catch((error) => {
        console.log('there was an error sending the query', error);
      });
  }
  render() {
    return <div onClick={this.onClick.bind(this)}>Click me</div>;
  }
}
NewEntry.propTypes = {
  mutate: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
};

const submitRepository = gql`
  mutation submitRepository($repoFullName: String!) {
    submitRepository(repoFullName: $repoFullName) {
      createdAt
    }
  }
`;

const NewEntryWithData = graphql(submitRepository)(NewEntry);
```

However, typically you'd want to keep the concern of formatting the mutation options out of your presentational component. The best way to do this is to use the [`props`](queries.html#graphql-props) argument to wrap the mutation in a function that accepts exactly the arguments it needs:

```js
import React, { Component, PropTypes } from 'react';
import { gql, graphql } from 'react-apollo';

class NewEntry extends Component {
  render() {
    return <div onClick={() => this.props.submit('apollostack/apollo-client')}>Click me</div>;
  }
}
NewEntry.propTypes = {
  submit: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
};

const submitRepository = /* as above */;

const NewEntryWithData = graphql(submitRepository, {
  props: ({ mutate }) => ({
    submit: (repoFullName) => mutate({ variables: { repoFullName } }),
  }),
})(NewEntry);
```

Note that, in general, you don't need to use the results from the mutation callback directly. Instead you should usually rely on Apollo's id-based cache updating to take care of it for you. If that doesn't cover your needs, you can pass an [`updateQueries`](cache-updates.html#updateQueries) callback to update any relevant queries with your mutation results.That way, you can keep your UI components as stateless and declarative as possible.

<h2 id="optimistic-ui">Optimistic UI</h2>

Sometimes your client code can easily predict the result of a successful mutation even before the server responds with the result. For instance, in GitHunt, when a user comments on a repository, we want to show the new comment in the UI immediately, without waiting on the latency of a round trip to the server, giving the user a faster UI experience. This is what we call [Optimistic UI](http://info.meteor.com/blog/optimistic-ui-with-meteor-latency-compensation). This is possible with Apollo if the client can predict an *Optimistic Response* for the mutation.

All you need to do is specify the `optimisticResponse` option. This "fake result" will be used to update active queries immediately, in the same way that the server's mutation response will. The optimistic patches are stored in a separate place in the cache, so once the actual mutation returns, the relevant optimistic update is automatically thrown away and replaced with the real result.

```js
import React, { Component, PropTypes } from 'react';
import { gql, graphql } from 'react-apollo';

class CommentPage extends Component { ... }
CommentPage.propTypes = {
  submit: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
};


const submitComment = gql`
  mutation submitComment($repoFullName: String!, $commentContent: String!) {
    submitComment(repoFullName: $repoFullName, commentContent: $commentContent) {
      postedBy {
        login
        html_url
      }
      createdAt
      content
    }
  }
`;

const CommentPageWithData = graphql(submitComment, {
  props: ({ ownProps, mutate }) => ({
    submit: ({ repoFullName, commentContent }) => mutate({
      variables: { repoFullName, commentContent },
      optimisticResponse: {
        __typename: 'Mutation',
        submitComment: {
          __typename: 'Comment',
          // Note that we can access the props of the container at `ownProps`
          postedBy: ownProps.currentUser,
          createdAt: +new Date,
          content: commentContent,
        },
      },
    });
  }),
})(CommentPage);
```

For the example above, it is easy to construct an optimistic response, since we know the shape of the new comment and can approximately predict the created data. The optimistic response doesn't have to be exactly correct because it will always will be replaced with the real result from the server, but it should be close enough to make users feel like there is no delay.

> As this comment is *new* and not visible in the UI before the mutation, it won't appear automatically on the screen as a result of the mutation. You can use [`updateQueries`](cache-updates.html#updateQueries) to make it appear in this case (and this is what we do in GitHunt).

<h2 id="mutation-results">Designing mutation results</h2>

When people talk about GraphQL, they often focus on the data fetching side of things, because that's where GraphQL brings the most value. Mutations can be pretty elegant if done well, but the principles of designing good mutations, and especially good mutation result types (`__typename` in the above example), are not yet well-understood in the open source community. So when you are working with mutations it might often feel like you need to make a lot of application-specific decisions.

In GraphQL, mutations can return any type, and that type can be queried just like a regular GraphQL query. So the question is - what type should a particular mutation return?

In most cases, the data available from a mutation result should be the server developer's best guess of the data a client would need to understand what happened on the server. For example, a mutation that creates a new comment on a blog post might return the comment itself. A mutation that reorders an array might need to return the whole array.

<h2 id="update-after-mutation">Updating the cache after a mutation</h2>

Most of the time it is not necessary to tell Apollo which parts of the cache to update. It can automatically figure out which objects have changed if you use [dataIdFromObject](cache-updates.html#dataIdFromObject). However, there are cases like inserting or deleting items from a list, which cannot be done that way. In those cases, you have a few options:

1. use [`refetchQueries`](cache-updates.html#refetchQueries) to completely refetch parts of your cache after the mutation has completed.
2. use [`updateQueries`](cache-updates.html#updateQueries) to specify how the mutation result affects results of previous queries in the cache.
